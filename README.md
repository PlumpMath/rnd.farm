# [rnd.farm](http://rnd.farm)

A stream of human generated randomness

## why?

"**True Randomness**" is the topic of
[Holo Magazine](http://holo-magazine.com/2/)'s upcoming issue #2 and
we've been working on a
[Genetic Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming)
system to create a design for the cover and other aspects. The GP
approach relies on selectively breeding programs by randomly
generating, mutating and mating a population of hundreds of deeply
nested
[abstract syntax trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree)
over a potentially large number of generations. As you can guess, this
all requires an endless amount of random numbers...

Even though we could (and so far did) use one of the many
pseudo-random number generators readily available, Holo is also very
much about documenting & involving a community which takes pride in
experimenting with seeing things from alternative perspectives.

So in light of this:

We'd like to do a little experiment and see if a large (or even not so
large) group of people can collectively generate better quality random
numbers than an algorithm. Intuitevely one would think and hope so,
but I fear our sample set will be heavily biased. Yet, even with that
the case, it will be fascinating to see if and how this might impact
an evolutionary process as it consumes our random choices. At some
point (once a sufficient amount of numbers has been collected/farmed -
with your incredible help, of course! :), it should be quite
enlightening to analyze the distribution itself in more detail.

## how?

The initial site is merely targeted at kickstarting the collection of
**our** random numbers (you can submit as many as you like). A simple,
public read-only API with optional seeding will be implemented in the
next few days to help integrating this stream into the above mentioned
GP setup.

The range of numbers supported is 0 .. 2^62
(4,611,686,018,427,387,904) and that limit is being enforced.

The app was built with:

* Clojure
* Leiningen
* Ring
* Compojure
* Hiccup
* Environ

## running locally

To start a local version on your own machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/postspectacular/rnd.farm.git
cd rnd.farm
RND_STREAM=random.txt lein ring server
```

After a few seconds, this will have launched the server on port 3000
and automatically opens the site in your browser. Numbers will be read
& written to the file given as `RND_STREAM`.
